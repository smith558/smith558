# I am <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Stanislav Modrak</span>, a <span style="font-weight: bolder;">freelance full-stack developer</span> based near London.

I started testing the water as a web designer and developer by joining [Revolware](https://revolware.com/) team in 2018\. Here I worked on projects like <span style="color: var(--maincolor);">Wasteno app</span> (an NGO trying to solve the problem of food waste) or <span style="color: var(--maincolor);">Deety</span> (a platform based on shared-economics connecting professional artists with customers).

Later in 2018, I co-founded [Proxima startup](https://smith558.github.io/) (a school company that developed and pitched tailored chatbot solutions to highschools and dormitories). I also joined [Slovensko.Digital](https://slovensko.digital/) NGO core team where I contributed to multiple <span style="color: var(--maincolor);">open-source</span> and private projects improving e-government of Slovakia.

In 2019 I began studying <span style="color: var(--maincolor);">Software Engineering</span> at the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/), UK.
